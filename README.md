# Proyecto - BÃºsqueda De Empleo

## :bulb: Project description
To keep **track** of my day-to-day life at the level of my job search, I have created a **job tracking application** in **Laravel**.

## Requirements
- **Display** all our **applied offers** with their **status** on the screen by **Endpoints** *(Blade).*
- There must be a **status position** that is *"In Progress"* or *"Completed".*
- We must be able to **delete, insert or modify** an entry through **Endpoints**.
- We have to be able to watch the show on **Endpoints** *(Blade)*
- **Date management**: *1 creation*, *2 last modification*.
- **test coverage**: *70% minimum*.
